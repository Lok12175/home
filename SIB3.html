	<h2>Why is Urbanization Happening in Beijing?</h2>
	
<img src= "Webpage Photos/mask.jpg"  width= "300" height="200" align="right">
<p>Beijing is located on historically agricultural and pastoral land surrounded by a semi-circle of mountains toward the north, the same 
mountains that hold The Great Wall of China. About 38% of Beijing is flatlands where most of urbanization is located and 62% is mountainous. 
The surrounding northern mountains create a basin for smog that contributes towards Beijing’s poor air condition. The northern mountains were 
a natural source of  defence against the nomadic invasions against Beijing. Beijing’s total area is 16 808 km2. Annual precipitation reaches 
about 22 inches mostly coming from June to August, annual sunshine is about 2671 hours and an average high temperature of18.083Cannually.
 Beijing is prone to natural disasters such as landslides & floods which are most common, however droughts, hail, typhoons, earthquakes,
 mudslides, snowstorms, and forest fires do still happen. Typhoons mostly come around the coastal region of China which is far from 
 beijing but depending on the severity of the storm, Beijing is still a possible target.</p>	
	
	<h2>What are the Environmental Impacts of Beijing?</h2>
<p>One of the main impacts that Beijing has on the environment is air pollution. The mass industrialization in combination with the basin
 the northern mountains form, a mass amount of smog collects in Beijing affecting the surrounding environment as well as its citizens. 
 The dumping of garbage and waste into the water not only makes the water unsafe to drink but kills the life inside the rivers, lakes,
 and surrounding parts of the ocean. This makes it hard for fishing close to shore. Pollution in the air can potentially lead to acid 
 rain and since most rain happens in June to August crops ready for harvest can be damaged and nonconsumable. </p>

	<h2>Why was Beijing settled?</h2>
<p>Beijing’s northern mountains were an excellent source of natural defence, Its high mountains could slow any invaders and protect the
 city. Thanks to It’s inner flatlands, it provided a source of agriculture, and a chance to start breeding livestock. Back before the 
 industrial revolution, there was little pollution and there was no sign that the northern mountains would hold all the smog in one place. 
 Een before the Industrial Revolution there was lots of greenery so this gave a lot of space for farming settling and breeding livestock.</p>
 
	<h2>Where are these problems impacting the most?</h2>
<p>The areas where the environment impacts the most is in central Beijing, where most urbanization is located. The are which we have chosen, 
represents this very well as there is lots of air pollution that we can solve in our development plan. The area we have chosen is near 
central beijing which has lots of industrialization. This was a poor choice as when in comparison to places like toronto we have major 	
factories close to the outer edge of places like central downtown. How this helps is the pollution caused by these factories cannot reach 
central downtown as it has already reached a high altitude before it reaches the heart of downtown. With beijing, the central partof
beijing houses mass industrialization, which impacts the residents inhabiting it. Water pollution, impacts the outer edge of beijing 
as well as surrounding states. The factories within and outside of beijing dump waste into the water which can flow down to central 
beijing which acts and a junction for water.</p>

	<h2>Solution To Pollution</h2>
<p>Since we can’t drill holes in the northern mountains to vent out the smog, we need to find a way to dissipate and lower the smog 
levels in Beijing. Beijing doesn’t have that much greenery and so the smog levels are not controlled. Since urbanization has already 
claimed most of the land we cannot destroy buildings in replace of forests because of the mass population in Beijing. While we cannot
 put greenery in the heart of Beijing, we can place greening projects along the northern mountains to control the amount of smog leaving 
 and reentering Beijing. By placing trees along the northern mountains smog can be turned into clean air and pushed back into the heart 
 of  Beijing by the down wind created by the mountains.</p>
