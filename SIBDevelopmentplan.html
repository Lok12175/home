	<h1>Making Beijing More Sustainable</h1>
	
<h2>Development Plan</h2>
<p>The region selected is the Hujialou Residential District which is located in Beijing, China. China is known for their mass pollution that 
affects the air quality and leads to things such as global warming. In our selected residential district, it is very much evident that this 
area has many unsustainable practices and the environment is already very poor in quality. </p>


Some things that this community already has that is benefitting this community is a park with many trees, and medical facilities that are 
easily accessible. The usage of land by putting parks in an area is beneficial as trees are scientifically proven to absorb carbon dioxide 
from the atmosphere.  The integration of nature in urbanized areas is an objective for many large cities. Trees can function as excellent 
natural thermoregulators( This regulates the temperature in certain areas ). With the provided shade from trees and the water vapour released 
by their leaves, they are able to lower the temperature by  2  to 8 °C on sunny days. They can also prevent the rapid evaporation of the water 
used for activities such as watering the grass fields or lawns. This saves both natural resources ( we need to use resources sustainably so 
that they can last for a longer duration or period of time ) and money. </p>


When creating a more sustainable city, there should be a variety of things implemented in order to move forwards and make progress. A few 
operations that could be done or fixed are things such as the use of energy and how to be more eco-friendly, limiting the amount of waste, 
usage of water and reducing the pollution of it, maintaining the land and reserving some areas of land for things such as parks, and being 
more consumer and eco-friendly at the same time. </p>


As stated earlier, your ways of transportation can start making a positive impact on the air quality. As less greenhouse gases are emitted 
into the air, this creates a more sustainable and healthy living environment for the citizens and all of the people including tourists.  
The usage of energy can constitute to climate change. Climate change is very important in our society as it is one of the most pressing 
sustainability issues in our modern day society. Working on numerous projects and initiatives can benefit cost savings, cleaner air and an 
overall healthier environment.  Some initiative that can take place are Green Building Standards, Renewable Energy and Central Plants. </p>


Buildings in communities could be designed to meet what is known as LEED Silver Criteria. LEED stands for Leadership on Energy and 
Environmental Design and is a standard that is set for ensuring environmental performance indicators are included in the design, 
construction and continuous operation of the buildings. Some places around the world such as University of Waterloo are committed to this 
and are ensure that all future building meet the LEED Standards. </p>

Renewable Energy is energy collected from renewable resources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides and waves. The usage of solar panel arrays 
can be beneficial as this reduces the carbon footprint on the earth. A carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide and other carbon 
compounds emitted due to the consumption of fossil fuels by a particular person or group. When there is a high concentration of carbon 
dioxide, it can be very harmful and toxic towards humans and animals. The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gases are 
all what leads to carbon dioxide. </p>


The burning of garbage affects the ozone layer when harmful chemicals known as dioxide and furans are emitted into the air. These chemicals 
go into the air, into the atmosphere and damage the ozone layer. This leads to problems such as the notorious Global Warming. If everyone 
were to reduce the amount of waste they put out, this could be beneficial. Things such as human waste would remain regular and you would 
not reduce this however, wastes that belong in the garbage such as styrofoam, pop bottles, plastic straws, and wax paper constitute to 
Global Warming. When the garbage is burned, it causes air pollutants such as carbon dioxide and mercury into the atmosphere. One way 
that the amount of toxic chemicals entering the atmosphere could be reduced is aiming at the cause. You can reduce the amount of waste 
you put out. Things as simple as coffee cups contribute greatly and negatively as they contain wax in them therefore meaning they cannot 
be recycled.  A solution for this is to use reusable containers and tumblers. If everyone were to use their own refillable or reusable mug 
everyday to the coffee shop, this would reduce the amount of waste greatly each day, week and so on. </p>


Maintain the quality of land in areas can be beneficial for the atmosphere. With things as simple as the planting of more trees could be 
beneficial. Trees are scientifically proven to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  The integration of nature in urbanized areas 
is an objective for many large cities. Trees can function as excellent natural thermoregulators( This regulates the temperature in certain 
areas ). With the provided shade from trees and the water vapour released by their leaves, they are able to lower the temperature by  2  to 
8°C on sunny days. They can also prevent the rapid evaporation of the water used for activities such as watering the grass fields or lawns. 
This saves both natural resources ( we need to use resources sustainably so that they can last for a longer duration or period of time ) and 
money. </p>


The implementing of many of these sustainability actions can be placed around the city and communities. Using the LEED design as mentioned 
earlier could be implemented in every new building or structure being built in communities and the city overall. These newly built structures 
feature the key and fundamental designs for sustainability.  Solar Panel Arrays could be placed on the rooftops of high rise building and any 
construction. These solar panel arrays can also be placed on the rooftops of houses to help supply partial energy for the home.  This is a good 
way of allowing sunlight to reach them and supply energy for the buildings. Allowing a reserved area, space or patch of land every few blocks 
reserved for natural  thermoregulators such as trees to aid with the reduction of carbon dioxide. The tree would not only be placed in the 
reserved parks or areas of land but be spread out evenly among the city. As a whole, these trees and other  thermoregulators will help create 
a more sustainable community as it promotes a healthy living environment. </p>


The slow and gradual change in ways of doing everyday things will slowly improve the environment. Using the LEED Standards for building new 
buildings and structures will  help conserve resources making them more sustainable for the future. The small changes to everything slowly 
adds up and accumulates into larger impacts on the environment thus making it a more sustainable community as a whole. Using this method for 
impact, this can better improve many things in a community. </p>
