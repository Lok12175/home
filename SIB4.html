	<h2>Breif Introduction</h2>
<p>As with any nation driven by economic growth and profit, a country must always find the balance between its nation’s economy and its 
environment. In order to be a successful, prosperous, and sustainable country, a nation’s government, citizens, and business corporations 
must all agree and work together to ensure both economic growth and environmental protection. China is no exception. However, in major 
cities such as Beijing, the balance has shifted to prioritize economic advancement which leaves environmental impacts to be. This has 
created a significant imbalance and problem that the people of Beijing must solve in order to become a comfortable, thriving, and 
sustainable city. In this section, I will explain the human impacts on the environment, along with the causes, the effects, the sides, 
and what this means for the overall development of Beijing as a city.</p>

	<h2>What are the main environmental problems and what are the causes?</h2>
 <p>China is ranked as the largest developing country in the world with a rapidly growing economy. Its GDP has increased by over 10% over 
the past twenty years, and China is continuing to expand and develop as a nation. With all this fast growth and success, China has expended 
much of its resources into advancing its economy and dealing with its poverty problems. Because of this, the environment has been largely 
ignored in some areas, and this has led to critical environmental problems that are easily recognizable. These main issues include air 
pollution, water pollution, desertification, and soil degradation. These issues are severe in major Chinese cities and pose a significant 
health hazard to millions of its citizens. 

Along with this, these problems question the future sustainability of the nation and whether it can continue having a prosperous economy. 
In Beijing, sustainability for the environment is a complex problem. The air pollution problem is one of the most notable once landed in 
Beijing. Air pollution is perhaps the most significant environmental issue for public health as it affects everyone living in the vicinity. 
There are many human causes for air pollution, and they all contribute to poor air quality. Firstly, because China has experienced tremendous 
economic growth in the last three decades, there has been a dramatic rise in GDP per capita. This increase in wealth has been seen to correlate 
with the increase of air pollution.

Because the GDP per capita has risen extensively, this means the purchasing power for Chinese citizens living in Beijing has increased as well. 
This leads onto the first cause which is motor emissions. Because citizens have more purchasing power, more and more people can purchase 
vehicles which drives the greenhouse gas emissions. The number of motor vehicles in Beijing has risen above 3.3 million with over 1200 new 
vehicles added every day. Emissions from motorized vehicles contribute to about 70% of the city’s air pollution. The impact of this is that 
dangerous pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and a hazardous inhalable chemical called PM 2.5 have 
increased in amount drastically, endangering the livelihood of Chinese citizens. Another primary cause that drives air pollution is the 
population growth. Beijing’s population has increased from 11 million to 16 million in only seven years, which means it has doubled in 
less than a decade. This intensive swell in population has led to more houses, apartment buildings, and motorized vehicles that all 
contribute to the already toxic air pollution in Beijing. 

The final cause of air pollution are the gas emissions coming from factories and coal-fueled power plants. These numerous factories 
contribute to smog in Beijing which threatens Chinese citizens, decreases vehicle visibility, and delays flights. The main reason why 
these plants are so disruptive lies in the technology and methods of the use of fossil fuels and coal. The factory’s technology is 
outdated and releases an enormous amount of greenhouse gases. Additionally, a handful of factories are located on the outskirts of 
Beijing at the nearby city of Harbin which allows winds to pick up smog to eventually engulf the city.

The impact of air pollution is the effect it has on the environment and the population. Chemicals in the air have shown to cause many 
respiratory problems, and many have prematurely died because of this issue. For example, the World Health Organization estimates that 
more than 300 000 die prematurely due to air pollution. The air pollution in Beijing causes lower birth rates and adult mortality from 
respiratory related diseases. Lung cancer rates have risen over 60% in the past ten years even though the smoking rate has remained the 
same. Another serious pollution issue is electronic waste management. About 70% of the world’s electronic waste is processed in China 
which poses a significant health risk to Chinese workers and residents alike. Water Pollution from these heavy metals such as lead, 
mercury, and arsenic have become increasingly prominent, seriously endangering the health of local citizens.</p>

	<h2>Why are the causes of these environmental problems being implemented?</h2>
<p>The leading causes of the environmental problems are solely based on the needs and wants of the government, private companies and 
organizations, and the general public. Recently, China’s government has put more attention in attending to the environment. China has 
enacted policies like the three-year plan to help better air and water pollution. More recent solutions involve suspending coal 
companies’ practices in an attempt to reduce air pollution. These are acts that were favoured by the public but not by the corporations. 
As a result, the Chinese government has not gone all out to fix their environment because of the coal and mining companies complaints 
as well as the economic growth they provide.

However, if the citizens keep complaining and protesting against a poor environment, the government will have to decide whether it wants 
to satisfy its people or its corporations. Chinese economic growth has been powered by a coal and fossil fuel industry resulting in the 
highest greenhouse gas emissions that include carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and primary PM in the world. Uneven development priorities 
concentrate most of the population, economic activities, and gas emissions in major cities such as Beijing, resulting in an overall severe 
air pollution situation in these cities. 

The Chinese citizens who live in these polluted cities want to take sustainable actions and preserve the health and safety of their 
environment. The Chinese government for many years and even now mainly aims to grow a healthy economy. However, in recent years they have 
noticed the extreme consequences of their coal and fossil fuel drive and have attended to the environmental issues at hand, dealing with 
the most severe ones first. While the government realizes the environmental situation, with millions remaining in poverty, economic growth 
is still the priority. </p>
	
	<h2>Who is affected and what is Beijing’s current living quality?</h2>
<p>Currently, every single person who lives in Beijing is either directly or indirectly affected by its environmental problems. For example, 
the most widespread of pollution such as air and water pollution are almost unavoidable in Beijing. Beijing’s current living quality varies 
from day to day and the days which have severe air pollution and smog are most dangerous. Air pollution is measured by the Air Quality Index 
or AQI, which indicates air pollution from a scale of 0 to 500. A reading of 100 and below are considered as “Blue Sky Days” when smog is not 
easily visible, and air quality is comfortable. However, the scale now goes up to 755 which is what the United States Embassy measured and 
recorded in Beijing. The United States Embassy in Beijing conducts its own pollution reading as opposed to native government readings. A reading 
of 755 is the highest level of air pollution ever recorded in Beijing, and the World Health Organization states that readings about 500 contain 
more than twenty times the safe level of gas emissions and other dangerous chemicals in the air.</p>

	<h2>When will these sustainable actions take place?</h2>
<p>Over recent years, China has paid much attention to the environmental problems arising from their prospering economy. They have now made 
environmental protection one of their basic national policies. Over the past two decades, China has experienced a GDP growth of about 10%,
and its environmental protection acts have made it so that its environment had not experienced that big of a fall. In 2013, the ministry 
of government had announced that they exceed their original goal of controlling air pollutants. A dangerous inhalable chemical, PM 2.5, 
which was rampant in Beijing had initially been tested to be 90 micrograms per cubic metre. This quantity of this chemical in the air 
in Beijing is over three times the amount that is considered dangerous by the World Health Organization which is about 25 micrograms 
per cubic metre. However, once China implemented its plan, the count dropped to 58 micrograms per cubic metre. 

This shows that China is putting effort into its environmental protections and it is already proving successful. In China’s five-year 
plan to protect the environment which started in 2015 and lasts until 2020, Beijing set a goal of improving the number of days with clean 
air to 80 percent, or about 292 days per year. However, this will prove a significant challenge since the air pollutants can come and go 
solely based off the weather. If the weather is terrible, smog will occur, and it will heavily sabotage their target goal.</p>
	
	<h2>Where will these implimentations be heavilty focused?</h2>
<p>Currently, Beijing has ordered cement and steel plants to suspend their production, and some few will go out forever. Beijing has 
also conducted frequent environmental inspections of local authorities. These plans are mainly focused on the industrial heard of 
Beijing, and it aims to disrupt the causes of pollution in the air. Beijing has also decided to punish lower-level authorities who 
fail to restrain the pollution. Restrictive policies have been implemented and are highly effective in moving coal power plants away 
from major cities, and replacing smaller, less efficient plants with larger ones. Downtown Beijing, for example, no longer uses coal 
to heat homes which has made a vast improvement. However, small-scale coal burning continues often using lower-quality coal that causes 
worse pollution. Even though China’s air pollutant plan has lowered the overall air pollution and prevented many deaths, the plan cannot 
be fully implemented due to the complaint of coal and heavy industries holding them back. Smog and air pollution control was just one 
part of the leadership’s green campaign, and the ministry had stated that they would provide a more concerted effort to take down 
environmental problems.</p>

		<h2>How can citizens help make sure the environment is sustainable in the future?</h2>
<p> Citizens can help make sure the environment is sustainable by taking daily steps to help better the environment. Citizens can help 
in organizations to help clean up garbage and participate in campaigns to repair the environment. By spreading the word and participating 
in environmental and health campaigns, the more the issue will gain popularity, and it is more likely that the government will turn to the 
citizens' requests. They must also help by reducing air pollution. Many citizens can try to take public transportation or commit to biking 
instead of using their own vehicles. Citizens can also throw out old refrigerators/air conditioners that may release harmful greenhouse 
gases. In conclusion, it is to be said that Chinese citizens who want to drink clean water can buy a water purifier; those worried about 
poisoned milk can buy safe imported milk. However, when the air is polluted, there is no option but to either accept it or fight it.</p>
