	<h2>Who are the people that will help take action to create a more sustainable area?</h2>
<p>The main people who run the city and allow things to pass are government figures. If a good figure or person with a good standing in 
terms of creating a more sustainable city is elected or is brought into the view of government officials, things can be changed. The main 
person to take action would be the public people or citizens and an elected member of the government with a well set mind for sustainability 
in their city. 

The member of the government, once elected would begin to propose to the higher standings of things that could be implemented in the city 
to create a more sustainable city. Once the things are implemented in the city by the government approving the actions to be taken, it is 
the job and role of the citizens to follow through with the implemented factors and key to sustainability and maintain these rules or actions. 
 
In our selected region/city ( Beijing ) some initiatives that could be taken are things such as more usage of public transportation. In Beijing, 
there is a wide variety of ways of transportation such as taxi, bus, subways etc however, if more people started to take advantage of public 
transportation, this can slowly positively impact the air quality as vehicles emit greenhouse gases which constitutes toxic air pollution. 
With more people taking public transit, this allows for more people to fit in one vehicle rather than everyone driving their own individual 
cars. If only a few people take the transit system, it is not beneficial as a large vehicle is emitting the same amount of pollution when 
only a few people are using it. However, when large amounts of people use it, it pays off well for the planet’s environment. Transportation 
is also cheap and is very convenient around this city as many people find it simple and easy to go to and from their workplaces by public 
transportation. 

Another way to help make a positive difference is by riding a bicycle or just simply walking to your desired destination. Walking is good 
for your health as it gives you a bit of an exercise and so does biking. If people changed their morning commute to walking or cycling, 
this could be very much beneficial for the air quality as this will reduce a great amount of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. 
Walking or cycling is also more economical and van save a great sum of money overtime as you would not have to pay for things such as gas 
for your vehicle and vehicle maintenance. Walking and cycling are great ways to save money, improve local air quality, reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions, and contribute to a healthier lifestyle.</p>
	
	<h2>What are the key factors that will be implemented in the city that will create a more sustainable area?</h2>
<p>When creating a more sustainable city, there should be a variety of things implemented in order to move forwards and make progress. 
A few operations that could be done or fixed are things such as the use of energy and how to be more eco-friendly, limiting the amount 
of waste, usage of water and reducing the pollution of it, maintaining the land and reserving some areas of land for things such as parks, 
and being more consumer and eco-friendly at the same time. 

As stated earlier, your ways of transportation can start making a positive impact on the air quality. As less greenhouse gases are emitted 
into the air, this creates a more sustainable and healthy living environment for the citizens and all of the people including tourists. 

The usage of energy can constitute to climate change. Climate change is very important in our society as it is one of the most pressing 
sustainability issues in our modern day society. Working on numerous projects and initiatives can benefit cost savings, cleaner air and 
an overall healthier environment.  Some initiative that can take place are Green Building Standards, Renewable Energy and Central Plants. 

Buildings in communities could be designed to meet what is known as LEED Silver Criteria. LEED stands for Leadership on Energy and 
Environmental Design and is a standard that is set for ensuring environmental performance indicators are included in the design, 
construction and continuous operation of the buildings. Some places around the world such as University of Waterloo are committed 
to this and are ensure that all future building meet the LEED Standards. 

Renewable Energy is energy collected from renewable resources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides and waves. The usage of solar panel 
arrays can be beneficial as this reduces the carbon footprint on the earth. A carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide and 
other carbon compounds emitted due to the consumption of fossil fuels by a particular person or group. When there is a high concentration 
of carbon dioxide, it can be very harmful and toxic towards humans and animals. The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural 
gases are all what leads to carbon dioxide. 

The burning of garbage affects the ozone layer when harmful chemicals known as dioxide and furans are emitted into the air. These chemicals 
go into the air, into the atmosphere and damage the ozone layer. This leads to problems such as the notorious Global Warming. If everyone 
were to reduce the amount of waste they put out, this could be beneficial. Things such as human waste would remain regular and you would 
not reduce this however, wastes that belong in the garbage such as styrofoam, pop bottles, plastic straws, and wax paper constitute to 
Global Warming. When the garbage is burned, it causes air pollutants such as carbon dioxide and mercury into the atmosphere. One way 
that the amount of toxic chemicals entering the atmosphere could be reduced is aiming at the cause. You can reduce the amount of waste 
you put out. Things as simple as coffee cups contribute greatly and negatively as they contain wax in them therefore meaning they cannot 
be recycled.  A solution for this is to use reusable containers and tumblers. If everyone were to use their own refillable or reusable 
mug everyday to the coffee shop, this would reduce the amount of waste greatly each day, week and so on. 

Maintain the quality of land in areas can be beneficial for the atmosphere. With things as simple as the planting of more trees could be 
beneficial. Trees are scientifically proven to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  The integration of nature in urbanized areas 
is an objective for many large cities. Trees can function as excellent natural thermoregulators( This regulates the temperature in certain 
areas ). With the provided shade from trees and the water vapour released by their leaves, they are able to lower the temperature by  2  to 
8 °C on sunny days. They can also prevent the rapid evaporation of the water used for activities such as watering the grass fields or 
lawns. This saves both natural resources ( we need to use resources sustainably so that they can last for a longer duration or period of 
time ) and money.</p>

	<h2>Where will we apply/implement these functions or systems in order to improve sustainability?</h2>
<p>The implementing of many of these sustainability actions can be placed around the city and communities. Using the LEED design as mentioned 
earlier could be implemented in every new building or structure being built in communities and the city overall. These newly built structures 
feature the key and fundamental designs for sustainability.  Solar Panel Arrays could be placed on the rooftops of high rise building and any 
construction. These solar panel arrays can also be placed on the rooftops of houses to help supply partial energy for the home.  This is a 
good way of allowing sunlight to reach them and supply energy for the buildings. Allowing a reserved area, space or patch of land every few 
blocks reserved for natural  thermoregulators such as trees to aid with the reduction of carbon dioxide. The tree would not only be placed 
in the reserved parks or areas of land but be spread out evenly among the city. As a whole, these trees and other  thermoregulators will 
help create a more sustainable community as it promotes a healthy living environment.</p>

	<h2>When would be the ideal time to implement these changes in terms of political situations and seasonal changes?</h2>
<p>In terms of political situations, if there is a poorly structured government, without proper ideals and a voice from the public. 
The main people who run the city and allow things to pass are government figures. If a good figure or person with a good standing in 
terms of creating a more sustainable city is elected or is brought into the view of government officials, things can be changed. The 
main person to take action would be the public people or citizens and an elected member of the government with a well set mind for 
sustainability in their city. This would be the ideal political time for making changes. 

In terms of seasonal changes, it would be ideal to implement these changes during the warmer and summer months. In Beijing, during the 
winter months specifically December, it does snow in that region. Planting things such as trees during the winter months would not be 
the ideal time for this operation.</p>

	<h2>Why are these changes going to be beneficial to the community?</h2>
<p>The slow and gradual change in ways of doing everyday things will slowly improve the environment. Using the LEED Standards for building 
new buildings and structures will  help conserve resources making them more sustainable for the future. The small changes to everything 
slowly adds up and accumulates into larger impacts on the environment thus making it a more sustainable community as a whole. Using this 
method for impact, this can better improve many things in a community.</p>
