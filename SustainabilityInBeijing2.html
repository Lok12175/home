	<h1> <id = "top"> Making Beijing More Sustainable</h1>
	
	<h2>Why I Chose This City</h2>

<p>I chose this city because I identified its economic growth as a huge success and decided 
to further study the impact of this economic growth on the environment and population. I found 
that Beijing had many environmental issues accompanied with its economic success. I decided to 
look into the factors that detail the human impacts as well as the environmental impacts. I
looked into the population demographics and how the city functioned. I found massive urbanization
in parts of Beijing and I can connect these issues to the main problem of environmental sustainability.
Finally, I decided to look into the ways we could make the city more sustainable to continue its 
environmental growth and stability.</p>

	
	<h2>What Are The Unsustainable Actions?</h2>

<p>Beijing is a growing city and with that brings a lot of development. Beijing is filled 
with many factories and workshops that have caused a lot pollution. Due to many big companies 
deciding to build their factories in Beijing for the cheap labour costs, Beijing is facing many 
other issues. Some of the problems the people and environment in Beijing are facing include air
 pollution, water pollution, desertification, and soil degradation. Emissions from motor vehicles 
also contribute to Beijing’s air pollution problem. There are more than 3.3 million cars in 
Beijing with 1200 cars added each day. Gas emissions from coal plants are the final cause of 
Beijing’s air pollution. Most factories and energy producing plants use coal for energy. They 
burn coal and fossil fuels, which mits many greenhouse gases into the air. The air quality in 
Beijing is very dangerous, since it is filled with smoke and you can even see the smog in the air.</p>

	<h2>What Are Some Sustainability Actions That Can Be Taken?</h2>

<p>Due to the mass pollution in this area, there should be a variety of things implemented in 
order to move forwards and make progress. A few operations that could be done or fixed are 
things such as the use of energy and how to be more eco-friendly, limiting the amount of waste,
usage of water and reducing the pollution of it, maintaining the land and reserving some areas
of land for things such as parks, and being more consumer and eco-friendly at the same time. 
Parks provide a space in which trees can be implemented. Trees serve as a natural thermoregulator
which is something that will keep the temperature controlled which can reduce or prevent global
warming. Using public transportation allows for more people to travel in one vehicle which can
reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the air. If everyone continued to drive in 
their own cars, the amount of emitted greenhouse gases would be much higher however, the use of 
public transit is equivalent to carpooling which is more eco-friendly. Reducing the amount of 
energy used can also benefit our community as the over-usage of energy constitutes to climate 
change.  Buildings in our community  could be designed to meet what is known as LEED Silver 
Criteria. LEED stands for Leadership on Energy and Environmental Design and is a standard 
that is set for ensuring environmental performance indicators are included in the design, 
construction and continuous operation of the buildings. Some places around the world such 
as University of Waterloo are committed to this and are ensure that all future building
meet the LEED Standards. LEED Silver Criteria standards are made in a way that actions 
are more sustainably made.</p>

	
	<h1>Population</h1>
<ol>1. How is the population in Beijing, China distributed?</ol>
<ol>2. What are some of the causes and reasons for this kind of population distribution?</ol>
<ol>3. When were the first settlements created?</ol>
<ol>4. Where are the most densely populated areas?</ol>
<ol>5. Why is urbanization happening in Beijing?</ol>
<ol>6. Who is causing the high growth rates?</ol>


	<h2>How is the population in Beijing China Distributed?</h2>

<p>Beijing is a city in China located in Northeast China bordering the Bohai Sea. 
Its bordering cities include Tianjin and Hebei. Beijing is the centre of economy, 
education, health care, politics, culture, technology, transportation and tourism 
in China. This has lead to many people from rural areas to move to Beijing for a 
better life.

Beijing, China has a population of over 21.7 million residents as of 2017. It also 
has an area of  16 800 km². By knowing this, we can find out the population density,
which is close to 6000 people per square kilometre. Comparing this to China’s national
population density at 500 people per square kilometre. This is a big difference, almost
twelve times the amount of people per square kilometre. From this, we can tell that Beijing 
is overpopulated and is being affected by urbanization. 

Beijing has a clustered distribution pattern. This means that the houses and people are 
tightly packed in a small area. The most populated district in Beijing is the Chaoyang 
District with 3 545 000 people. The most densely populated district is the Xicheng 
district with more than 26 000 people per square kilometre. The population in Beijing 
has grown by 15 million since 1975.

It has a population growth rate of 2.12% per year since the 1950s. It had a rapid 
growth between 1980 and 2010 with an average growth rate of nearly 4% during that 
period. The global population growth rate is currently close to 1.09%, which is 
basically half of the growth rate in Beijing. The population is continuing to 
grow rapidly and is becoming a problem for the residents that live in Beijing.</p>

	<h2>What are some of the causes and reasons for this kind of population distribution?</h2>

<p>The first known settlements in Beijing (aka Peking; previous name) traces back to 3000 B.C.E 
or earlier. It was originally home to many farming settlements. This was because there were many 
rivers and waterways that go through Beijing. These rivers include the Yongding River, Chaobai River,
Hai River and the Grand Canal. The Grand Canal is an artificial or man-made river. It is the longest
of its kind. It was 1 776 km and stretched from Beijing to Hangzhou. This has helped with transportation, 
since people could use boats to get from Beijing to China. This was one of the best transportation routes 
for farmers to transport goods across the country and it attracted people to Beijing, since it was very
close. This was very useful and convenient for the farmers and residents that were living in Beijing a
long time ago.

In the modern day, people have been moving and settling in Beijing because it is a meeting point site.
It is home to many business headquarters in China and is where many trades and business deals take place.
Beijing can also be considered a harbour site. It is nearby the Bohai Sea, which is north of the Yellow Sea. 
They are both inside the North Pacific Ocean, which is the second biggest ocean. The benefits of being a 
harbour site include easier imports and exports overseas</p>

	<h2>When were the first settlements created?</h2>

<p>Beijing’s settlements go back a very long time in history. It also has a very interesting history as 
well. There were many different rulers and emperors that controlled Beijing. There were also different 
Dynasties such as the Zhou Dynasty, Qin Dynasty and the Tang Dynasty. 

Beijing was established 3 000 years ago and was called Jin City during the Western Zhou Dynasty. It is 
one of the four most ancient cities in China. The other three include Xian, Luoyang, and Nanjing. Back 
then, Beijing was thriving on agriculture and the cultivation of animals. Zhoulu, a town west of modern-day 
Beijing was the first metropolis built in that area. Shortly after, Emperor Yao built a new capital, Youdo 
(modern-day City of Ji).  

The first settlements in Beijing were built around the biggest waterways because it helped with agriculture 
and the rural lifestyle. The freshwater rivers included the Yongding and Chaobai Rivers. Beijing also has 
relatively flat land making it really easier for farmers to be able to farm and have good agriculture. 

After many different rulers, emperors and dynasties later, on October 1, 1949, Beijing became part of the 
People’s Republic of China. It was the capital of the People’s Republic of China. It has improved a lot since 
then. Shanghai has become the most populated city in China, but Beijing has improved as well. It has become the 
second most populated city in China and an economic powerhouse. It has a GDP of 247.7 million dollars in 2010 
and $12 447 GDP per capita. This is the third highest out of all the cities in China, only behind Tianjin and Shanghai.</p>

	<h2>Where are the Most Densely Populated Areas?</h2>

<p>On average, Beijing has a population of 6000 people per square kilometre, but some areas and districts are much more 
dense and much less dense. The population density in China is only 500 people per square kilometre, which is much less. 
Beijing is the second most populated city in China behind Shanghai.
Beijing is split up into administrative districts. It has sixteen different districts. They include Chaoyang District, 
Haidian District, Fengtai District, Changping District, Daxing District, Xicheng District, Tongzhou District, Fangshan 
District, Dongcheng District, Shunyi District, Shijingshan District, Miyun County, Pinggu District, Huairou District, 
Yanqing County, and the Mentougou District.

The most densely populated region out of these is the Xicheng District with more than 26 000 people living in a square 
kilometre. The second is the Dongcheng District with more than 22 000 people per square kilometre. As you can see in 
the map above, both the Xicheng District and the Dongcheng are located in the centre of Beijing. This is probably 
because of urbanization and urban sprawl. People would have moved to Dongcheng and Xicheng and then once that became 
overpopulated, people would have moved and settled in new cities outwards.

The least densely populated regions include the Huairou District with only 146 people per square kilometre. 
This is because it is a more rural settlement compared to the others. 90% of the land is also covered with mountains, 
which makes it harder for people to be able to live there. The Huairou District is located on the outer edge north of Beijing.</p>

	<h2>Why is Urbanization Happening in Beijing?</h2>

<p>Urbanization has become a big problem in Beijing. It is one of the main reasons for Beijing's large population growth rate. 
Urbanization is when people from rural areas moved into urban settlements usually for better education, healthcare, or employment 
opportunities. China’s urban population was 1980 was 191 million or 9 percent of China’s population. In 1997, it was 380 
million or 30 percent of China’s population. In 2015, 767.5 million people or 55.88% of China’s population lived in urban 
settlements. This shows that there has been an increasing trend for people to move to urban settlements.

Beijing is the economic powerhouse of China. This is because it is home to many employment opportunities. The employment 
opportunities has attracted many people from rural settlements because their only jobs were mostly farming and agriculture. 
In 2009, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, the urban income per capita was nearly $2 500. This was three 
times the rural income per capita. This shows that there is a huge financial difference between the people living in rural 
and urban settlements.

In China, it is estimated that more than 80% of doctors and healthcare workers are concentrated in urban areas. 
This means that the majority of the rural population does not have proper access to healthcare. More than 40% of China’s 
population lives in rural areas and most of them have to travel far to seek healthcare. In addition to this by 2035, more 
than 25% of the Chinese population will be over the age of 60. This means that they will need to receive more and better healthcare.

Education in rural China also need a lot of improvement. There aren’t enough schools in rural areas in China and children 
are having to travel for hours to get to school each day. The picture on the  right shows a bunch of children in China climbing 
a ladder up a mountain to get to school. It is a picture that went viral in 2016 because six or seven children had died after 
they slipped off that ladder. They don’t get the proper supplies and often the teachers aren’t as qualified as teachers 
in urban areas. In China, basic education costs money and most families living in rural areas aren’t able to afford it, 
so the kids usually can’t go to school.</p>

	<h2>Who is Causing the High Population Growth Rates?</h2>
<img src = "Webpage Photos/populationgrowth.jpg" width = "300" height = "200"/>
<p>China had grown a lot in population, especially between 1950 and 2000. It had almost doubled in population going 
from 600 million to 1.3 billion people. There are many reason for the rapid population growth in China. It is mostly 
caused by the rural population. This is because it is easier for families to farm if they have more people, so they 
choose to have more children. It is also because the mortality rates for children was really high. This made people 
to choose to have more children, since there was a relatively high chance of that child not being able to survive for
too long.</p>

<ol>4. Why was Beijing settled?</ol>
<ol>5. Where are these problems impacting the most?</ol>
<ol>6. How can we solve the environmental problems of Beijing?</ol>

	<h2>Why is Urbanization Happening in Beijing?</h2>

<p>Beijing is located on historically agricultural and pastoral land surrounded by a semi-circle of mountains toward the north, the same 
mountains that hold The Great Wall of China. About 38% of Beijing is flatlands where most of urbanization is located and 62% is mountainous. 
The surrounding northern mountains create a basin for smog that contributes towards Beijing’s poor air condition. The northern mountains were 
a natural source of  defence against the nomadic invasions against Beijing. Beijing’s total area is 16 808 km2. Annual precipitation reaches 
about 22 inches mostly coming from June to August, annual sunshine is about 2671 hours and an average high temperature of18.083Cannually.
 Beijing is prone to natural disasters such as landslides & floods which are most common, however droughts, hail, typhoons, earthquakes,
 mudslides, snowstorms, and forest fires do still happen. Typhoons mostly come around the coastal region of China which is far from 
 beijing but depending on the severity of the storm, Beijing is still a possible target.</p>	
	
	<h2>What are the Environmental Impacts of Beijing?</h2>
<p>One of the main impacts that Beijing has on the environment is air pollution. The mass industrialization in combination with the basin
 the northern mountains form, a mass amount of smog collects in Beijing affecting the surrounding environment as well as its citizens. 
 The dumping of garbage and waste into the water not only makes the water unsafe to drink but kills the life inside the rivers, lakes,
 and surrounding parts of the ocean. This makes it hard for fishing close to shore. Pollution in the air can potentially lead to acid 
 rain and since most rain happens in June to August crops ready for harvest can be damaged and nonconsumable. </p>
 <img src = "Webpage Photos/40aday.jpg" width = "300" height = "400"/>
 
	<h2>Why was Beijing settled?</h2>
<p>Beijing’s northern mountains were an excellent source of natural defence, Its high mountains could slow any invaders and protect the
 city. Thanks to It’s inner flatlands, it provided a source of agriculture, and a chance to start breeding livestock. Back before the 
 industrial revolution, there was little pollution and there was no sign that the northern mountains would hold all the smog in one place. 
 Een before the Industrial Revolution there was lots of greenery so this gave a lot of space for farming settling and breeding livestock.</p>
 
	<h2>Where are these problems impacting the most?</h2>
<p>The areas where the environment impacts the most is in central Beijing, where most urbanization is located. The are which we have chosen, 
represents this very well as there is lots of air pollution that we can solve in our development plan. The area we have chosen is near 
central beijing which has lots of industrialization. This was a poor choice as when in comparison to places like toronto we have major 	
factories close to the outer edge of places like central downtown. How this helps is the pollution caused by these factories cannot reach 
central downtown as it has already reached a high altitude before it reaches the heart of downtown. With beijing, the central partof
beijing houses mass industrialization, which impacts the residents inhabiting it. Water pollution, impacts the outer edge of beijing 
as well as surrounding states. The factories within and outside of beijing dump waste into the water which can flow down to central 
beijing which acts and a junction for water.</p>

	<h2>Solution To Pollution</h2>
<p><Since we can’t drill holes in the northern mountains to vent out the smog, we need to find a way to dissipate and lower the smog 
levels in Beijing. Beijing doesn’t have that much greenery and so the smog levels are not controlled. Since urbanization has already 
claimed most of the land we cannot destroy buildings in replace of forests because of the mass population in Beijing. While we cannot
 put greenery in the heart of Beijing, we can place greening projects along the northern mountains to control the amount of smog leaving 
 and reentering Beijing. By placing trees along the northern mountains smog can be turned into clean air and pushed back into the heart 
 of  Beijing by the down wind created by the mountains.</p>

	<h2>Breif Introduction</h2>
<p>As with any nation driven by economic growth and profit, a country must always find the balance between its nation’s economy and its 
environment. In order to be a successful, prosperous, and sustainable country, a nation’s government, citizens, and business corporations 
must all agree and work together to ensure both economic growth and environmental protection. China is no exception. However, in major 
cities such as Beijing, the balance has shifted to prioritize economic advancement which leaves environmental impacts to be. This has 
created a significant imbalance and problem that the people of Beijing must solve in order to become a comfortable, thriving, and 
sustainable city. In this section, I will explain the human impacts on the environment, along with the causes, the effects, the sides, 
and what this means for the overall development of Beijing as a city.</p>

	<h2>What are the main environmental problems and what are the causes?</h2>
 <p>China is ranked as the largest developing country in the world with a rapidly growing economy. Its GDP has increased by over 10% over 
the past twenty years, and China is continuing to expand and develop as a nation. With all this fast growth and success, China has expended 
much of its resources into advancing its economy and dealing with its poverty problems. Because of this, the environment has been largely 
ignored in some areas, and this has led to critical environmental problems that are easily recognizable. These main issues include air 
pollution, water pollution, desertification, and soil degradation. These issues are severe in major Chinese cities and pose a significant 
health hazard to millions of its citizens. 

Along with this, these problems question the future sustainability of the nation and whether it can continue having a prosperous economy. 
In Beijing, sustainability for the environment is a complex problem. The air pollution problem is one of the most notable once landed in 
Beijing. Air pollution is perhaps the most significant environmental issue for public health as it affects everyone living in the vicinity. 
There are many human causes for air pollution, and they all contribute to poor air quality. Firstly, because China has experienced tremendous 
economic growth in the last three decades, there has been a dramatic rise in GDP per capita. This increase in wealth has been seen to correlate 
with the increase of air pollution.

Because the GDP per capita has risen extensively, this means the purchasing power for Chinese citizens living in Beijing has increased as well. 
This leads onto the first cause which is motor emissions. Because citizens have more purchasing power, more and more people can purchase 
vehicles which drives the greenhouse gas emissions. The number of motor vehicles in Beijing has risen above 3.3 million with over 1200 new 
vehicles added every day. Emissions from motorized vehicles contribute to about 70% of the city’s air pollution. The impact of this is that 
dangerous pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and a hazardous inhalable chemical called PM 2.5 have 
increased in amount drastically, endangering the livelihood of Chinese citizens. Another primary cause that drives air pollution is the 
population growth. Beijing’s population has increased from 11 million to 16 million in only seven years, which means it has doubled in 
less than a decade. This intensive swell in population has led to more houses, apartment buildings, and motorized vehicles that all 
contribute to the already toxic air pollution in Beijing. 

The final cause of air pollution are the gas emissions coming from factories and coal-fueled power plants. These numerous factories 
contribute to smog in Beijing which threatens Chinese citizens, decreases vehicle visibility, and delays flights. The main reason why 
these plants are so disruptive lies in the technology and methods of the use of fossil fuels and coal. The factory’s technology is 
outdated and releases an enormous amount of greenhouse gases. Additionally, a handful of factories are located on the outskirts of 
Beijing at the nearby city of Harbin which allows winds to pick up smog to eventually engulf the city.

The impact of air pollution is the effect it has on the environment and the population. Chemicals in the air have shown to cause many 
respiratory problems, and many have prematurely died because of this issue. For example, the World Health Organization estimates that 
more than 300 000 die prematurely due to air pollution. The air pollution in Beijing causes lower birth rates and adult mortality from 
respiratory related diseases. Lung cancer rates have risen over 60% in the past ten years even though the smoking rate has remained the 
same. Another serious pollution issue is electronic waste management. About 70% of the world’s electronic waste is processed in China 
which poses a significant health risk to Chinese workers and residents alike. Water Pollution from these heavy metals such as lead, 
mercury, and arsenic have become increasingly prominent, seriously endangering the health of local citizens.</p>
 
	<h2>Why are the causes of these environmental problems being implemented?</h2>
<p>The leading causes of the environmental problems are solely based on the needs and wants of the government, private companies and 
organizations, and the general public. Recently, China’s government has put more attention in attending to the environment. China has 
enacted policies like the three-year plan to help better air and water pollution. More recent solutions involve suspending coal 
companies’ practices in an attempt to reduce air pollution. These are acts that were favoured by the public but not by the corporations. 
As a result, the Chinese government has not gone all out to fix their environment because of the coal and mining companies complaints 
as well as the economic growth they provide.

However, if the citizens keep complaining and protesting against a poor environment, the government will have to decide whether it wants 
to satisfy its people or its corporations. Chinese economic growth has been powered by a coal and fossil fuel industry resulting in the 
highest greenhouse gas emissions that include carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and primary PM in the world. Uneven development priorities 
concentrate most of the population, economic activities, and gas emissions in major cities such as Beijing, resulting in an overall severe 
air pollution situation in these cities. 

The Chinese citizens who live in these polluted cities want to take sustainable actions and preserve the health and safety of their 
environment. The Chinese government for many years and even now mainly aims to grow a healthy economy. However, in recent years they have 
noticed the extreme consequences of their coal and fossil fuel drive and have attended to the environmental issues at hand, dealing with 
the most severe ones first. While the government realizes the environmental situation, with millions remaining in poverty, economic growth 
is still the priority. </p>
	
	<h2>Who is affected and what is Beijing’s current living quality?</h2>
<p>Currently, every single person who lives in Beijing is either directly or indirectly affected by its environmental problems. For example, 
the most widespread of pollution such as air and water pollution are almost unavoidable in Beijing. Beijing’s current living quality varies 
from day to day and the days which have severe air pollution and smog are most dangerous. Air pollution is measured by the Air Quality Index 
or AQI, which indicates air pollution from a scale of 0 to 500. A reading of 100 and below are considered as “Blue Sky Days” when smog is not 
easily visible, and air quality is comfortable. However, the scale now goes up to 755 which is what the United States Embassy measured and 
recorded in Beijing. The United States Embassy in Beijing conducts its own pollution reading as opposed to native government readings. A reading 
of 755 is the highest level of air pollution ever recorded in Beijing, and the World Health Organization states that readings about 500 contain 
more than twenty times the safe level of gas emissions and other dangerous chemicals in the air.</p>
	
	<h2>When will these sustainable actions take place?</h2>
<p>Over recent years, China has paid much attention to the environmental problems arising from their prospering economy. They have now made 
environmental protection one of their basic national policies. Over the past two decades, China has experienced a GDP growth of about 10%,
and its environmental protection acts have made it so that its environment had not experienced that big of a fall. In 2013, the ministry 
of government had announced that they exceed their original goal of controlling air pollutants. A dangerous inhalable chemical, PM 2.5, 
which was rampant in Beijing had initially been tested to be 90 micrograms per cubic metre. This quantity of this chemical in the air 
in Beijing is over three times the amount that is considered dangerous by the World Health Organization which is about 25 micrograms 
per cubic metre. However, once China implemented its plan, the count dropped to 58 micrograms per cubic metre. 

This shows that China is putting effort into its environmental protections and it is already proving successful. In China’s five-year 
plan to protect the environment which started in 2015 and lasts until 2020, Beijing set a goal of improving the number of days with clean 
air to 80 percent, or about 292 days per year. However, this will prove a significant challenge since the air pollutants can come and go 
solely based off the weather. If the weather is terrible, smog will occur, and it will heavily sabotage their target goal.</p>
	
	<h2>Where will these implimentations be heavilty focused?</h2>
<p>Currently, Beijing has ordered cement and steel plants to suspend their production, and some few will go out forever. Beijing has 
also conducted frequent environmental inspections of local authorities. These plans are mainly focused on the industrial heard of 
Beijing, and it aims to disrupt the causes of pollution in the air. Beijing has also decided to punish lower-level authorities who 
fail to restrain the pollution. Restrictive policies have been implemented and are highly effective in moving coal power plants away 
from major cities, and replacing smaller, less efficient plants with larger ones. Downtown Beijing, for example, no longer uses coal 
to heat homes which has made a vast improvement. However, small-scale coal burning continues often using lower-quality coal that causes 
worse pollution. Even though China’s air pollutant plan has lowered the overall air pollution and prevented many deaths, the plan cannot 
be fully implemented due to the complaint of coal and heavy industries holding them back. Smog and air pollution control was just one 
part of the leadership’s green campaign, and the ministry had stated that they would provide a more concerted effort to take down 
environmental problems.</p>

		<h2>How can citizens help make sure the environment is sustainable in the future?</h2>
<p> Citizens can help make sure the environment is sustainable by taking daily steps to help better the environment. Citizens can help 
in organizations to help clean up garbage and participate in campaigns to repair the environment. By spreading the word and participating 
in environmental and health campaigns, the more the issue will gain popularity, and it is more likely that the government will turn to the 
citizens' requests. They must also help by reducing air pollution. Many citizens can try to take public transportation or commit to biking 
instead of using their own vehicles. Citizens can also throw out old refrigerators/air conditioners that may release harmful greenhouse 
gases. In conclusion, it is to be said that Chinese citizens who want to drink clean water can buy a water purifier; those worried about 
poisoned milk can buy safe imported milk. However, when the air is polluted, there is no option but to either accept it or fight it.</p>	
	
	<h1>Sustainability</h1>
<ol>1. Who are the people that will help take action to create a more sustainable area?</ol>
<ol>2. What are the key factors that will be implemented in the city that will create a more sustainable area?</ol>
<ol>3. Where will we apply/implement these functions or systems in order to improve sustainability?</ol>
<ol>4. When would be the ideal time to implement these changes in terms of political situations and seasonal changes?</ol>
<ol>5. Why are these changes going to be beneficial to the community?</ol>
	
	<h2>Who are the people that will help take action to create a more sustainable area?</h2>
<p>The main people who run the city and allow things to pass are government figures. If a good figure or person with a good standing in 
terms of creating a more sustainable city is elected or is brought into the view of government officials, things can be changed. The main 
person to take action would be the public people or citizens and an elected member of the government with a well set mind for sustainability 
in their city. 

The member of the government, once elected would begin to propose to the higher standings of things that could be implemented in the city 
to create a more sustainable city. Once the things are implemented in the city by the government approving the actions to be taken, it is 
the job and role of the citizens to follow through with the implemented factors and key to sustainability and maintain these rules or actions. 
 
In our selected region/city ( Beijing ) some initiatives that could be taken are things such as more usage of public transportation. In Beijing, 
there is a wide variety of ways of transportation such as taxi, bus, subways etc however, if more people started to take advantage of public 
transportation, this can slowly positively impact the air quality as vehicles emit greenhouse gases which constitutes toxic air pollution. 
With more people taking public transit, this allows for more people to fit in one vehicle rather than everyone driving their own individual 
cars. If only a few people take the transit system, it is not beneficial as a large vehicle is emitting the same amount of pollution when 
only a few people are using it. However, when large amounts of people use it, it pays off well for the planet’s environment. Transportation 
is also cheap and is very convenient around this city as many people find it simple and easy to go to and from their workplaces by public 
transportation. 

Another way to help make a positive difference is by riding a bicycle or just simply walking to your desired destination. Walking is good 
for your health as it gives you a bit of an exercise and so does biking. If people changed their morning commute to walking or cycling, 
this could be very much beneficial for the air quality as this will reduce a great amount of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. 
Walking or cycling is also more economical and van save a great sum of money overtime as you would not have to pay for things such as gas 
for your vehicle and vehicle maintenance. Walking and cycling are great ways to save money, improve local air quality, reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions, and contribute to a healthier lifestyle.</p>
	
	<h2>What are the key factors that will be implemented in the city that will create a more sustainable area?</h2>
<p>When creating a more sustainable city, there should be a variety of things implemented in order to move forwards and make progress. 
A few operations that could be done or fixed are things such as the use of energy and how to be more eco-friendly, limiting the amount 
of waste, usage of water and reducing the pollution of it, maintaining the land and reserving some areas of land for things such as parks, 
and being more consumer and eco-friendly at the same time. 

As stated earlier, your ways of transportation can start making a positive impact on the air quality. As less greenhouse gases are emitted 
into the air, this creates a more sustainable and healthy living environment for the citizens and all of the people including tourists. 

The usage of energy can constitute to climate change. Climate change is very important in our society as it is one of the most pressing 
sustainability issues in our modern day society. Working on numerous projects and initiatives can benefit cost savings, cleaner air and 
an overall healthier environment.  Some initiative that can take place are Green Building Standards, Renewable Energy and Central Plants. 

Buildings in communities could be designed to meet what is known as LEED Silver Criteria. LEED stands for Leadership on Energy and 
Environmental Design and is a standard that is set for ensuring environmental performance indicators are included in the design, 
construction and continuous operation of the buildings. Some places around the world such as University of Waterloo are committed 
to this and are ensure that all future building meet the LEED Standards. 

Renewable Energy is energy collected from renewable resources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides and waves. The usage of solar panel 
arrays can be beneficial as this reduces the carbon footprint on the earth. A carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide and 
other carbon compounds emitted due to the consumption of fossil fuels by a particular person or group. When there is a high concentration 
of carbon dioxide, it can be very harmful and toxic towards humans and animals. The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural 
gases are all what leads to carbon dioxide. 

The burning of garbage affects the ozone layer when harmful chemicals known as dioxide and furans are emitted into the air. These chemicals 
go into the air, into the atmosphere and damage the ozone layer. This leads to problems such as the notorious Global Warming. If everyone 
were to reduce the amount of waste they put out, this could be beneficial. Things such as human waste would remain regular and you would 
not reduce this however, wastes that belong in the garbage such as styrofoam, pop bottles, plastic straws, and wax paper constitute to 
Global Warming. When the garbage is burned, it causes air pollutants such as carbon dioxide and mercury into the atmosphere. One way 
that the amount of toxic chemicals entering the atmosphere could be reduced is aiming at the cause. You can reduce the amount of waste 
you put out. Things as simple as coffee cups contribute greatly and negatively as they contain wax in them therefore meaning they cannot 
be recycled.  A solution for this is to use reusable containers and tumblers. If everyone were to use their own refillable or reusable 
mug everyday to the coffee shop, this would reduce the amount of waste greatly each day, week and so on. 

Maintain the quality of land in areas can be beneficial for the atmosphere. With things as simple as the planting of more trees could be 
beneficial. Trees are scientifically proven to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  The integration of nature in urbanized areas 
is an objective for many large cities. Trees can function as excellent natural thermoregulators( This regulates the temperature in certain 
areas ). With the provided shade from trees and the water vapour released by their leaves, they are able to lower the temperature by  2  to 
8 °C on sunny days. They can also prevent the rapid evaporation of the water used for activities such as watering the grass fields or 
lawns. This saves both natural resources ( we need to use resources sustainably so that they can last for a longer duration or period of 
time ) and money.</p>
	
	<h2>Where will we apply/implement these functions or systems in order to improve sustainability?</h2>
<p>The implementing of many of these sustainability actions can be placed around the city and communities. Using the LEED design as mentioned 
earlier could be implemented in every new building or structure being built in communities and the city overall. These newly built structures 
feature the key and fundamental designs for sustainability.  Solar Panel Arrays could be placed on the rooftops of high rise building and any 
construction. These solar panel arrays can also be placed on the rooftops of houses to help supply partial energy for the home.  This is a 
good way of allowing sunlight to reach them and supply energy for the buildings. Allowing a reserved area, space or patch of land every few 
blocks reserved for natural  thermoregulators such as trees to aid with the reduction of carbon dioxide. The tree would not only be placed 
in the reserved parks or areas of land but be spread out evenly among the city. As a whole, these trees and other  thermoregulators will 
help create a more sustainable community as it promotes a healthy living environment.</p>

	<h2>When would be the ideal time to implement these changes in terms of political situations and seasonal changes?</h2>
<p>In terms of political situations, if there is a poorly structured government, without proper ideals and a voice from the public. 
The main people who run the city and allow things to pass are government figures. If a good figure or person with a good standing in 
terms of creating a more sustainable city is elected or is brought into the view of government officials, things can be changed. The 
main person to take action would be the public people or citizens and an elected member of the government with a well set mind for 
sustainability in their city. This would be the ideal political time for making changes. 

In terms of seasonal changes, it would be ideal to implement these changes during the warmer and summer months. In Beijing, during the 
winter months specifically December, it does snow in that region. Planting things such as trees during the winter months would not be 
the ideal time for this operation.</p>

	<h2>Why are these changes going to be beneficial to the community?</h2>
<p>The slow and gradual change in ways of doing everyday things will slowly improve the environment. Using the LEED Standards for building 
new buildings and structures will  help conserve resources making them more sustainable for the future. The small changes to everything 
slowly adds up and accumulates into larger impacts on the environment thus making it a more sustainable community as a whole. Using this 
method for impact, this can better improve many things in a community.</p>

	<h1>Unsustainable Activities</h1>

<ol>1. Who runs these unsustainable activities?</ol>
<ol>2. Why do these activities occur?</ol>
<ol>3. What factors affect their sustainability?</ol>
<ol>4. How can they become sustainable again?</ol>	

	<h2>Who Runs These Unsustainable Activities?</h2>
<p> Mainly, many manufacturing companies in Beijing run unethical practices in their factories. This includes sweatshops and terrible 
work conditions for the workers. Sweatshops have large amounts of workers working for less than minimum wage, terrible work conditions, 
and terrible hours. These unethical practices are run as it is cheaper to run a bad factory which is what majority of these managers are 
looking for, profit. Another factor that affects this is the high demand for products which connects with their overpopulation problems. 
They have overpopulation problems as their carrying capacity is higher than the population that they can actually sustain. The managers 
of these factories are selfish and look out for maximum profit, which is a large contributor to many of the unsustainable activities in

Beijing.</p>	

	<h2>Why Do These Activities Occur?</h2>
<p>In order to figure out, why these activities occur, we should know what majority of the activities are. Majority of the activities that 
lead Beijing to be unsustainable is factories. As I have already explained above / before, the majority of Beijing's sustainability problems 
come from their pollution. This includes environmental pollution (littering), and air pollution. Majority of Beijing’s air pollution comes 
from their absurd amount of manufacturing plants. These plants include factories that make clothing, technology, and more. As I have said 
before these factories have many people and some even run unethical practices on said people. They work for an under minimum wage salary 
and can barely afford their homes as the apartments in Beijing can cost up to $100. 000. This is barely affordable for many in Beijing, 
and is such a high rent that some are forced out of their homes. The price of homes are this large as Beijing’s carrying capacity is higher 
than their sustainable population which is why there is a higher demand for homes. As a result the price goes up so that there are enough 
to go around. Those that cannot afford them live in slums (small shacks with some essential items) or are just homeless.

Now that we know where majority of these activities come from, we can determine why these activities occur. There is a large increase in 
factories in Beijing as the population is rapidly increasing. The reason the amount of factories increase as the population increases is 
because as the population increases, there is a higher demand for essentials or wants needed. This means that there has to be a higher 
production rate, thus the increase in factories. It is hard to keep a good salary for all workers which is why the managers take the easy 
way out and pay their workers less than minimum wage. This is why many cannot afford homes in Beijing. The reason housing prices in Beijing 
are high is also because of their rapidly increasing population / carrying capacity which is larger than the actual population they can 
sustain. The large amount of factories not only affects the lives of many civilians but also affects the air quality, which is explained 
above in chapter 2 and 3. These activities occur because as the population rapidly increases so does the demand for essentials and wants 
in Beijing.</p>
	
	<h2>What Factors Affect Their Sustainability?</h2>
<p>Many factors affect Beijing’s sustainability. Beijing is a large area with lots of industrial operations going on at any given moment. 
This is only one of the many reasons to which why Beijing is unsustainable.  The major and more direct reason is Beijing’s insane population. 
Their carrying capacity is way above their sustainable population. This means that many people in Beijing are going to be homeless or living 
in shacks or slums. Not only does Beijing’s population make many homeless. It also affects their air pollution and environmental pollution 
indirectly. Due to the increased population, there is a higher demand for essentials and wants. This means that there is a need for a more 
efficient factory which is why many more factories and built and more workers are hired. These workers may be put through unethical practices 
because of their managers. These managers give their workers under minimum wage jobs because they try to run their factories in cheaper ways. 
The more factories that are built, the more pollution that is sent into the air. These are the major factors that make Beijing unsustainable 
and affect their sustainability overall. Let us take a closer look at the building plans in Beijing.</p>
	
	<h2>How Can They Become Sustainable Again?</h2>
<p>In order to make Beijing sustainable once more, we should know what sustainability is. Sustainability is the ability to be maintained at a 
certain rate or level. When sustainability is not achieved. Many people cannot afford to have their basic human rights met. This is why people 
are forced to live in slums. Slums are small shack type living environments, which people are forced to live in because they cannot afford 
any better.		

Many authorities in Beijing have already started to take many innovative steps to make Beijing a sustainable community once more. One step 
they took as to decrease air pollution. They started their step to decrease air pollution by decreasing the amount of cars that have access 
to the city center. This system is sorted by license plates. Beijing restricted the amount of cars that have access to the city center by 
allowing only certain license plates in. Not only this but Beijing decided to start planting an extensive amount of plants around the city 
in an attempt to make a “green wall”. Green walls are walls which have a large and visible amount of greenery on a wall. This is when people 
plant plants and flowers on walls. Many people get creative with their designs which gives green walls a better image in Beijing. This 
inspires more people to plant green walls which leaves a good impact on Beijing long term.

In order to become sustainable again, they should continue on their way, by taking the same steps to reduce air pollution by restricting the 
amount of cars, and planting plants. Although these are good methods to remain sustainability, this is not fast enough. A major problem in 
Beijing is overpopulation, as their “carrying capacity” is over the actual population that they can sustain. A way they can fix this is by 
making their policies more strict as they barely recognize their problems by not caring much about their pollution. They can also decrease 
their carrying capacity as due to overpopulation and there being a shortage of homes, an apartment in Beijing can cost up to $100,000 USD. 
More in how to solve this issue will be represented in other areas (previously mentioned)</p>

	<h1>Development Plan</h1>
<p>The region selected is the Hujialou Residential District which is located in Beijing, China. China is known for their mass pollution that 
affects the air quality and leads to things such as global warming. In our selected residential district, it is very much evident that this 
area has many unsustainable practices and the environment is already very poor in quality. 

Some things that this community already has that is benefitting this community is a park with many trees, and medical facilities that are 
easily accessible. The usage of land by putting parks in an area is beneficial as trees are scientifically proven to absorb carbon dioxide 
from the atmosphere.  The integration of nature in urbanized areas is an objective for many large cities. Trees can function as excellent 
natural thermoregulators( This regulates the temperature in certain areas ). With the provided shade from trees and the water vapour released 
by their leaves, they are able to lower the temperature by  2  to 8 °C on sunny days. They can also prevent the rapid evaporation of the water

reserved parks or areas of land but be spread out evenly among the city. As a whole, these trees and other  thermoregulators will help create 
a more sustainable community as it promotes a healthy living environment. 

The slow and gradual change in ways of doing everyday things will slowly improve the environment. Using the LEED Standards for building new 
buildings and structures will  help conserve resources making them more sustainable for the future. The small changes to everything slowly 
adds up and accumulates into larger impacts on the environment thus making it a more sustainable community as a whole. Using this method for 
impact, this can better improve many things in a community. </p>
