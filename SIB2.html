	<h2>How is the population in Beijing China Distributed?</h2>

<p>Beijing is a city in China located in Northeast China bordering the Bohai Sea. 
Its bordering cities include Tianjin and Hebei. Beijing is the centre of economy, 
education, health care, politics, culture, technology, transportation and tourism 
in China. This has lead to many people from rural areas to move to Beijing for a 
better life.

Beijing, China has a population of over 21.7 million residents as of 2017. It also 
has an area of  16 800 km². By knowing this, we can find out the population density,
which is close to 6000 people per square kilometre. Comparing this to China’s national
population density at 500 people per square kilometre. This is a big difference, almost
twelve times the amount of people per square kilometre. From this, we can tell that Beijing 
is overpopulated and is being affected by urbanization. 

Beijing has a clustered distribution pattern. This means that the houses and people are 
tightly packed in a small area. The most populated district in Beijing is the Chaoyang 
District with 3 545 000 people. The most densely populated district is the Xicheng 
district with more than 26 000 people per square kilometre. The population in Beijing 
has grown by 15 million since 1975.

It has a population growth rate of 2.12% per year since the 1950s. It had a rapid 
growth between 1980 and 2010 with an average growth rate of nearly 4% during that 
period. The global population growth rate is currently close to 1.09%, which is 
basically half of the growth rate in Beijing. The population is continuing to 
grow rapidly and is becoming a problem for the residents that live in Beijing.</p>

	<h2>What are some of the causes and reasons for this kind of population distribution?</h2>

<p>The first known settlements in Beijing (aka Peking; previous name) traces back to 3000 B.C.E 
or earlier. It was originally home to many farming settlements. This was because there were many 
rivers and waterways that go through Beijing. These rivers include the Yongding River, Chaobai River,
Hai River and the Grand Canal. The Grand Canal is an artificial or man-made river. It is the longest
of its kind. It was 1 776 km and stretched from Beijing to Hangzhou. This has helped with transportation, 
since people could use boats to get from Beijing to China. This was one of the best transportation routes 
for farmers to transport goods across the country and it attracted people to Beijing, since it was very
close. This was very useful and convenient for the farmers and residents that were living in Beijing a
long time ago.

In the modern day, people have been moving and settling in Beijing because it is a meeting point site.
It is home to many business headquarters in China and is where many trades and business deals take place.
Beijing can also be considered a harbour site. It is nearby the Bohai Sea, which is north of the Yellow Sea. 
They are both inside the North Pacific Ocean, which is the second biggest ocean. The benefits of being a 
harbour site include easier imports and exports overseas</p>

	<h2>When were the first settlements created?</h2>

<p>Beijing’s settlements go back a very long time in history. It also has a very interesting history as 
well. There were many different rulers and emperors that controlled Beijing. There were also different 
Dynasties such as the Zhou Dynasty, Qin Dynasty and the Tang Dynasty. 

Beijing was established 3 000 years ago and was called Jin City during the Western Zhou Dynasty. It is 
one of the four most ancient cities in China. The other three include Xian, Luoyang, and Nanjing. Back 
then, Beijing was thriving on agriculture and the cultivation of animals. Zhoulu, a town west of modern-day 
Beijing was the first metropolis built in that area. Shortly after, Emperor Yao built a new capital, Youdo 
(modern-day City of Ji).  

The first settlements in Beijing were built around the biggest waterways because it helped with agriculture 
and the rural lifestyle. The freshwater rivers included the Yongding and Chaobai Rivers. Beijing also has 
relatively flat land making it really easier for farmers to be able to farm and have good agriculture. 

After many different rulers, emperors and dynasties later, on October 1, 1949, Beijing became part of the 
People’s Republic of China. It was the capital of the People’s Republic of China. It has improved a lot since 
then. Shanghai has become the most populated city in China, but Beijing has improved as well. It has become the 
second most populated city in China and an economic powerhouse. It has a GDP of 247.7 million dollars in 2010 
and $12 447 GDP per capita. This is the third highest out of all the cities in China, only behind Tianjin and Shanghai.</p>

	<h2>Where are the Most Densely Populated Areas?</h2>

<p>On average, Beijing has a population of 6000 people per square kilometre, but some areas and districts are much more 
dense and much less dense. The population density in China is only 500 people per square kilometre, which is much less. 
Beijing is the second most populated city in China behind Shanghai.
Beijing is split up into administrative districts. It has sixteen different districts. They include Chaoyang District, 
Haidian District, Fengtai District, Changping District, Daxing District, Xicheng District, Tongzhou District, Fangshan 
District, Dongcheng District, Shunyi District, Shijingshan District, Miyun County, Pinggu District, Huairou District, 
Yanqing County, and the Mentougou District.

The most densely populated region out of these is the Xicheng District with more than 26 000 people living in a square 
kilometre. The second is the Dongcheng District with more than 22 000 people per square kilometre. As you can see in 
the map above, both the Xicheng District and the Dongcheng are located in the centre of Beijing. This is probably 
because of urbanization and urban sprawl. People would have moved to Dongcheng and Xicheng and then once that became 
overpopulated, people would have moved and settled in new cities outwards.

The least densely populated regions include the Huairou District with only 146 people per square kilometre. 
This is because it is a more rural settlement compared to the others. 90% of the land is also covered with mountains, 
which makes it harder for people to be able to live there. The Huairou District is located on the outer edge north of Beijing.</p>

	<h2>Why is Urbanization Happening in Beijing?</h2>

<p>Urbanization has become a big problem in Beijing. It is one of the main reasons for Beijing's large population growth rate. 
Urbanization is when people from rural areas moved into urban settlements usually for better education, healthcare, or employment 
opportunities. China’s urban population was 1980 was 191 million or 9 percent of China’s population. In 1997, it was 380 
million or 30 percent of China’s population. In 2015, 767.5 million people or 55.88% of China’s population lived in urban 
settlements. This shows that there has been an increasing trend for people to move to urban settlements.

Beijing is the economic powerhouse of China. This is because it is home to many employment opportunities. The employment 
opportunities has attracted many people from rural settlements because their only jobs were mostly farming and agriculture. 
In 2009, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, the urban income per capita was nearly $2 500. This was three 
times the rural income per capita. This shows that there is a huge financial difference between the people living in rural 
and urban settlements.

In China, it is estimated that more than 80% of doctors and healthcare workers are concentrated in urban areas. 
This means that the majority of the rural population does not have proper access to healthcare. More than 40% of China’s 
population lives in rural areas and most of them have to travel far to seek healthcare. In addition to this by 2035, more 
than 25% of the Chinese population will be over the age of 60. This means that they will need to receive more and better healthcare.

Education in rural China also need a lot of improvement. There aren’t enough schools in rural areas in China and children 
are having to travel for hours to get to school each day. The picture on the  right shows a bunch of children in China climbing 
a ladder up a mountain to get to school. It is a picture that went viral in 2016 because six or seven children had died after 
they slipped off that ladder. They don’t get the proper supplies and often the teachers aren’t as qualified as teachers 
in urban areas. In China, basic education costs money and most families living in rural areas aren’t able to afford it, 
so the kids usually can’t go to school.</p>

	<h2>Who is Causing the High Population Growth Rates?</h2>
<img src= "Webpage Photos/populationgrowth.jpg"  width= "500" height="300" align="left">
<p>China had grown a lot in population, especially between 1950 and 2000. It had almost doubled in population going 
from 600 million to 1.3 billion people. There are many reason for the rapid population growth in China. It is mostly 
caused by the rural population. This is because it is easier for families to farm if they have more people, so they 
choose to have more children. It is also because the mortality rates for children was really high. This made people 
to choose to have more children, since there was a relatively high chance of that child not being able to survive for
too long.</p>
