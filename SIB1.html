<h1>Intro To Making Beijing More Sustainable</h1>

	<h2>Why I Chose This City</h2>

<p>I chose this city because I identified its economic growth as a huge success and decided 
to further study the impact of this economic growth on the environment and population. I found 
that Beijing had many environmental issues accompanied with its economic success. I decided to 
look into the factors that detail the human impacts as well as the environmental impacts. I
looked into the population demographics and how the city functioned. I found massive urbanization
in parts of Beijing and I can connect these issues to the main problem of environmental sustainability.
Finally, I decided to look into the ways we could make the city more sustainable to continue its 
environmental growth and stability.</p>

	<h2>What Are The Unsustainable Actions?</h2>

<p>Beijing is a growing city and with that brings a lot of development. Beijing is filled 
with many factories and workshops that have caused a lot pollution. Due to many big companies 
deciding to build their factories in Beijing for the cheap labour costs, Beijing is facing many 
other issues. Some of the problems the people and environment in Beijing are facing include air
 pollution, water pollution, desertification, and soil degradation. Emissions from motor vehicles 
also contribute to Beijing’s air pollution problem. There are more than 3.3 million cars in 
Beijing with 1200 cars added each day. Gas emissions from coal plants are the final cause of 
Beijing’s air pollution. Most factories and energy producing plants use coal for energy. They 
burn coal and fossil fuels, which mits many greenhouse gases into the air. The air quality in 
Beijing is very dangerous, since it is filled with smoke and you can even see the smog in the air.</p>

	<h2>What Are Some Sustainability Actions That Can Be Taken?</h2>

<p>Due to the mass pollution in this area, there should be a variety of things implemented in 
order to move forwards and make progress. A few operations that could be done or fixed are 
things such as the use of energy and how to be more eco-friendly, limiting the amount of waste,
usage of water and reducing the pollution of it, maintaining the land and reserving some areas
of land for things such as parks, and being more consumer and eco-friendly at the same time. 
Parks provide a space in which trees can be implemented. Trees serve as a natural thermoregulator
which is something that will keep the temperature controlled which can reduce or prevent global
warming. Using public transportation allows for more people to travel in one vehicle which can
reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the air. If everyone continued to drive in 
their own cars, the amount of emitted greenhouse gases would be much higher however, the use of 
public transit is equivalent to carpooling which is more eco-friendly. Reducing the amount of 
energy used can also benefit our community as the over-usage of energy constitutes to climate 
change.  Buildings in our community  could be designed to meet what is known as LEED Silver 
Criteria. LEED stands for Leadership on Energy and Environmental Design and is a standard 
that is set for ensuring environmental performance indicators are included in the design, 
construction and continuous operation of the buildings. Some places around the world such 
as University of Waterloo are committed to this and are ensure that all future building
meet the LEED Standards. LEED Silver Criteria standards are made in a way that actions 
are more sustainably made.</p>
