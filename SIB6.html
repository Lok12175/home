	<h2>Who Runs These Unsustainable Activities?</h2>
<p> Mainly, many manufacturing companies in Beijing run unethical practices in their factories. This includes sweatshops and terrible 
work conditions for the workers. Sweatshops have large amounts of workers working for less than minimum wage, terrible work conditions, 
and terrible hours. These unethical practices are run as it is cheaper to run a bad factory which is what majority of these managers are 
looking for, profit. Another factor that affects this is the high demand for products which connects with their overpopulation problems. 
They have overpopulation problems as their carrying capacity is higher than the population that they can actually sustain. The managers 
of these factories are selfish and look out for maximum profit, which is a large contributor to many of the unsustainable activities in

	<h2>Why Do These Activities Occur?</h2>
<p>In order to figure out, why these activities occur, we should know what majority of the activities are. Majority of the activities that 
lead Beijing to be unsustainable is factories. As I have already explained above / before, the majority of Beijing's sustainability problems 
come from their pollution. This includes environmental pollution (littering), and air pollution. Majority of Beijing’s air pollution comes 
from their absurd amount of manufacturing plants. These plants include factories that make clothing, technology, and more. As I have said 
before these factories have many people and some even run unethical practices on said people. They work for an under minimum wage salary 
and can barely afford their homes as the apartments in Beijing can cost up to $100. 000. This is barely affordable for many in Beijing, 
and is such a high rent that some are forced out of their homes. The price of homes are this large as Beijing’s carrying capacity is higher 
than their sustainable population which is why there is a higher demand for homes. As a result the price goes up so that there are enough 
to go around. Those that cannot afford them live in slums (small shacks with some essential items) or are just homeless.

Now that we know where majority of these activities come from, we can determine why these activities occur. There is a large increase in 
factories in Beijing as the population is rapidly increasing. The reason the amount of factories increase as the population increases is 
because as the population increases, there is a higher demand for essentials or wants needed. This means that there has to be a higher 
production rate, thus the increase in factories. It is hard to keep a good salary for all workers which is why the managers take the easy 
way out and pay their workers less than minimum wage. This is why many cannot afford homes in Beijing. The reason housing prices in Beijing 
are high is also because of their rapidly increasing population / carrying capacity which is larger than the actual population they can 
sustain. The large amount of factories not only affects the lives of many civilians but also affects the air quality, which is explained 
above in chapter 2 and 3. These activities occur because as the population rapidly increases so does the demand for essentials and wants 
in Beijing.</p>
	
	<h2>What Factors Affect Their Sustainability?</h2>
<p>Many factors affect Beijing’s sustainability. Beijing is a large area with lots of industrial operations going on at any given moment. 
This is only one of the many reasons to which why Beijing is unsustainable.  The major and more direct reason is Beijing’s insane population. 
Their carrying capacity is way above their sustainable population. This means that many people in Beijing are going to be homeless or living 
in shacks or slums. Not only does Beijing’s population make many homeless. It also affects their air pollution and environmental pollution 
indirectly. Due to the increased population, there is a higher demand for essentials and wants. This means that there is a need for a more 
efficient factory which is why many more factories and built and more workers are hired. These workers may be put through unethical practices 
because of their managers. These managers give their workers under minimum wage jobs because they try to run their factories in cheaper ways. 
The more factories that are built, the more pollution that is sent into the air. These are the major factors that make Beijing unsustainable 
and affect their sustainability overall. Let us take a closer look at the building plans in Beijing.</p>

	<h2>How Can They Become Sustainable Again?</h2>
<p>In order to make Beijing sustainable once more, we should know what sustainability is. Sustainability is the ability to be maintained at a 
certain rate or level. When sustainability is not achieved. Many people cannot afford to have their basic human rights met. This is why people 
are forced to live in slums. Slums are small shack type living environments, which people are forced to live in because they cannot afford 
any better.		

Many authorities in Beijing have already started to take many innovative steps to make Beijing a sustainable community once more. One step 
they took as to decrease air pollution. They started their step to decrease air pollution by decreasing the amount of cars that have access 
to the city center. This system is sorted by license plates. Beijing restricted the amount of cars that have access to the city center by 
allowing only certain license plates in. Not only this but Beijing decided to start planting an extensive amount of plants around the city 
in an attempt to make a “green wall”. Green walls are walls which have a large and visible amount of greenery on a wall. This is when people 
plant plants and flowers on walls. Many people get creative with their designs which gives green walls a better image in Beijing. This 
inspires more people to plant green walls which leaves a good impact on Beijing long term.

In order to become sustainable again, they should continue on their way, by taking the same steps to reduce air pollution by restricting the 
amount of cars, and planting plants. Although these are good methods to remain sustainability, this is not fast enough. A major problem in 
Beijing is overpopulation, as their “carrying capacity” is over the actual population that they can sustain. A way they can fix this is by 
making their policies more strict as they barely recognize their problems by not caring much about their pollution. They can also decrease 
their carrying capacity as due to overpopulation and there being a shortage of homes, an apartment in Beijing can cost up to $100,000 USD.
